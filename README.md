# ðŸ’¸ Expense Tracker

This project is an improved version of the expense tracker built in **Week 10**.  
The application allows users to manage personal expenses effectively, with enhanced features for filtering, editing, and tracking.

### ðŸ§  What I did this week:

This project is a simple and functional Expense Tracker built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**. It allows users to:

- Add new expenses with description, amount, and category
- Edit existing expenses by clicking on their description
- Delete individual expenses
- Filter expenses by category
- Clear all expenses at once
- See the total amount spent
- Persist data using `localStorage`

### ðŸš€ Improvements and Key Features

- **Edit mode**: Clicking on the expense description loads its data into the form and allows updating.
- **Category filter**: You can filter expenses by selecting a category.
- **Reset filters**: A button clears any applied filters to show all expenses again.
- **Data persistence**: Uses `localStorage` so that data is not lost on refresh.
- **Form validation**: Prevents empty descriptions or invalid amounts.
